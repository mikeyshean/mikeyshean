Whew! What a wild past couple of weeks it has been.  I've been working on a bunch of different things to launch this site you're on right now and the associated [Projects](/projects) 
that have brought me all over the stack.  There were victories and frustrations along the way, but also many new concepts learned and skills added to the toolbox.
I hope to document the things that I'm working on here and the interesting, unusual, innovative, bleeding-edge, helpful, and/or fun things I come across along the way .
Hope you enjoy and thanks for stopping by! ðŸ¥³

## Escape from Krypton (Preview)

A reboot of one of the projects I demoed at the end of my studies at App Academy.  According to github it's been over 7 years since this bad boy has been live for all the
internet to enjoy. You're welcome.

It is a FlappyBird inspired game that was originally a Javascript + jQuery game using HTML Canvas that ran entirely on the browser.  It did also have a Rails backend for the leaderboard tracking (which I left vulnerable to being faked).

To bring it into the modern era I chose maximum pain by deciding to migrate it to TypeScript as a NextJS project using the <Link href="https://create.t3.gg/">t3 stack.</Link> 
A lot of the things I'm working on not so much because it's the easy thing to do, but because I wanted to brush up and learn both NextJS and TypeScript better, so I'm intentionally 
choosing to implement things that forces me to learn new things along the way.


## More to come:
- API Mapper as a no-code integration builder (Django, NextJS13 with experimental `app` features)
- AWS CoPilot
- TailwindCSS
- NextJS with React

*P.S. Although I'd consider myself more of a backend engineer, I've recently been inspired to become a more skilled frontend practioner focusing on React, NextJS, and TypeScript.  You'll probably see me post a lot more about new (or old) frontend concepts that I'm only just coming across for the first time.*


{/* It started with the API Mapper project to get it to a state where I can deploy to a test ECS Fargate AWS environment through the use of AWS Co-pilot.
This included a Django backend with a Next.js frontend in React.

What I just summed up in those two sentences involved quite a wild, but fun and rewarding journey.  Wading through
the depths of Docker networks, AWS VPCs, my return to the frontend with Next.js and TypeScript to try out what all the cool kids are using these days.

I'll have a whole post dedicated to that project once I get the UI in decent shape.  At the same time I've been working on starting and deploying this site your reading on. */}
