This JavaScript based browser game is a reboot of one of my projects that I demoed at the end of my studies at App Academy.  According 
to the original <a href="https://github.com/mikeyshean/kryptonite" target="_blank">Github Repo</a> it's been over 7 years(?!) 
since this bad boy has been live for all the world to enjoy! You are very welcome.
## Background

Inspired by the mobile game FlappyBird, I had originally written the game in pure JavaScript/jQuery and used HTML's 
`<canvas>` <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API" target="_blank">API</a> to render it all in the browser. I took 
it a step further than the original assignment of just creating a JavaScript based brower game by building a Ruby/Rails backend API to 
track high scores and persist that data for "All Time High Scores" to be available to all visitors of the site. It was a big hit 
with the rest of the students and my backend leaderboard API was quickly "hacked" and overrun with fake scores by my classmates who were 
all very eager to wield their newly obtained web developer skills ðŸ˜….  

## Goals 

To bring it into the modern era I chose maximum pain by deciding to migrate it to TypeScript as a NextJS project using the <a href="https://create.t3.gg/" target="_blank">t3 stack.</a> 
A lot of the decisions I'm making regarding which language, framework, and/or tools I'm using lately are being made not so 
much because it's the easiest or fastest way to go, but because I want to intentionally force myself to learn new things along the way. It's definitely been slower and more painful 
but overall a very rewarding experience.

## New Features for the Reboot:
- [ ] Leaderboard that is *less* hackable
- [ ] Scrolling background art
- [ ] Mute sound toggle
