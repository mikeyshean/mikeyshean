This JavaScript based browser game is a reboot of one of my final projects that I demoed at the end of my studies at App Academy.  As you 
can imagine, it holds some sentimental value for me, but it's been over *seven years* since this bad boy has been 
live for all the world to enjoy.

That's why I thought it was about time that I dust it off, upgrade it, and give it a new place to call home.  You can play it now by 
clicking the button below, or continue reading to learn more about the project ðŸ˜„

## Background

Inspired by the mobile game **FlappyBird**, I created the <a href="https://github.com/mikeyshean/kryptonite">first version</a> of 
this game in 2015. Originally, I wrote it all in  JavaScript / jQuery and used HTML5's Canvas to render it all in the 
browser. 

I took it a step further than the original assignment of creating a JavaScript based browser game by building 
a <a href="https://github.com/mikeyshean/leaderboard">Ruby / Rails LeaderboardAPI</a>.  I used this to 
track high scores and persist data for the "Leaderboard" to be available to all visitors of the site. It was a big hit 
with the rest of the students (and even my instructors!), but my backend leaderboard API was quickly "hacked" and overrun 
with fake scores by my classmates who were all too eager to wield their newly obtained web developer skills ðŸ˜….  

## Game Design

I used HTML5 / Canvas for the rendering which was pretty fun to work with. It allows you to create your own sprites as an image source 
to paint onto the canvas. I actually drew my own Kryptonite in Photoshop for the obstacles:

<div className="flex justify-center">
  <Image src={kryptoniteSource} className="" alt="kryptonite source images" />
</div>

The game randomly selects the height and calculates how much it needs for the top and bottom piece. It takes into account the `Kryptonite.GAP`
constant and any `Kryptonite.PADDING` Iâ€™ve allowed to make the hit boxes a bit more friendly, then it takes the appropriate slice 
from the source image and paints it onto the canvas. COOL, RIGHT?!


## Collision Detection

During development I had the "flying object" (which I didn't know would be Superman at the time) represented as a circle 
which clearly did not work too well once I did switch to using the Superman sprite:

<SuperImage src={superCircle} caption="Hey, that's not a collision!" alt="superman with circle hit box" />

The white paths show the true boundaries used for determining collisions. Even with padding,
you can see that the circle wonâ€™t be very accurate anymore. So, I changed Superman's hit box shape to a triangle instead. Okay, now 
that we've defined the hit box boundaries, we need to define how we will detect our collisions:

### `sideCollision()`
Here we detect when the right vertical edge of Superman's triangular hit box collides with the left edge of the Kryptonite. An extra 
qualifying condition to check is whether the top of Superman is above the lowest edge of the upper Kryptonite or the bottom of Superman is below the top 
edge of the lower Kryptonite.

<Image src={sideCollision} alt=""/>

### `gapCollision()`

Here we detect when the top point or bottom edge of Superman collides with the top/bottom edges of the Kryptonite within the gap.

<Image src={gapCollision} alt=""/>

### `trigCollision()`
Finally, we detect when the rear hypotenuse edge of Superman's hit box collides with the bottom edge of the top Kryptonite. Due to the 
shape of Superman with his cape, a circle or quadrilateral hit box would trigger a collision where visually it did not appear that one occurred.  A 
trianglur hit box proved to allow more accurate collision detection.

<Image src={trigCollision} alt=""/>

This required a slight change in how the collision would be detected as Superman rises past this particular edge. Using an 
Isosceles Right Triangle made this slightly easier:

<Image src={trigDiagram} alt=""/>

Simply put, while ***k*** is between points ***a*** and ***b***, a collision is triggered if the length of 
***kx*** is less than the length of ***ax***. A nice and easy solution after I initially thought I would need to 
whip out some trig functions for this one.




## Updates for 2022

To bring it into the modern era, I chose *maximum pain* by deciding to migrate it to **TypeScript** as a **Next.js** project using 
the <a href="https://create.t3.gg/" target="_blank">t3 stack</a>.  With it I'll be leveraging **tRPC/Prisma** to replace the Ruby/Rails LeaderboardAPI 
for a completely fullstack Next.js application. 

As a predominantly backend engineer, this was an excellent exercise in both TypeScript and React.  I've used a bit of both 
at TravelPerk, but not with a very strong understanding of all the differences between `useEffect`, `useState`, and `useContext`. Luckily,
I had to become acutely aware of the nuances of each as I React-ified my vanilla JavaScript game.  A single unintended re-render or 
firing of a `useEffect` side-effect would cause the game to glitch out.

For context, a lot of the decisions I made regarding which language, framework, and/or tools to use were not because 
it was the easiest or fastest way to do it, but because I wanted to intentionally force myself to learn new things along 
the way. It's been slower and more painful this way, and sometimes a complete overengineering of the project, but it's been a 
great way to test myself and have fun while learning new skills.  I mean, who doesn't want to play with all the new shiny things anyways?


## Going Forward

As I resurrected this game I found myself finding all sorts of improvements I wanted to work on.  Overall, most of the actual 
game mechanics will remain unchanged.  I have to give myself credit for creating an actual playable game, but there are plenty of nice to haves 
and of course refactorings that would go a long way to keep iterating on it.  

One "bug" I did discover is the scoring mechanic which is currently calculated by the number of kryptonite that are created.  This isn't entirely accurate 
as the timing of kryptonite creation doesn't actually align with the true score.  In the most likely scenario where the player flies into the kryptonite 
it is usually accurate, however if the player reaches a `gameOver` state by flying below the play area, the scoring will not be accurate.

## New Features for the Reboot:
- [ ] Leaderboard that is *less* hackable with server-side game validation
- [ ] Mute sound toggle
- [ ] Scrolling background art
