This **JavaScript** based browser game is a reboot of one of my projects that I demoed at the end of my studies at App Academy.  As you can imagine, it holds some 
sentimental significance for me.  Sadly, according to the original <a href="https://github.com/mikeyshean/kryptonite" target="_blank">Github Repo</a> it's been over ***7 years***(?!) 
since this bad boy has been live for all the world to enjoy.

That's why I thought it was about time I dusted it off and gave it a new place to call home.  Play now by clicking the button, or continue reading to learn more about the project ðŸ˜„

## Background

Inspired by the mobile game **FlappyBird**, I had originally written the game in pure **JavaScript/jQuery** and used HTML's 
`<canvas>` API to render it all in the browser. At the time, I took it a step further than the original assignment which was to just create a JavaScript based browser game by building a 
<a href="https://github.com/mikeyshean/leaderboard" target="_blank">Ruby/Rails LeaderboardAPI</a>.  I used this to 
track high scores and persist data for "All Time High Scores" to be available to all the visitors of the site. It was a big hit 
with the rest of the students and my backend leaderboard API was quickly "hacked" and overrun with fake scores by my classmates who were 
all too eager to wield their newly obtained web developer skills ðŸ˜….  

## Goals 

To bring it into the modern era I chose maximum pain by deciding to migrate it to **TypeScript** as a **NextJS** project using the <a href="https://create.t3.gg/" target="_blank">t3 stack</a> which would 
also leverage **tRPC/Prisma** to replace the Ruby/Rails LeaderboardAPI and have a completely fullstack NextJS application. 

A lot of the decisions I've made lately regarding which language, framework, and/or tools to use have not been because it's the easiest or fastest way to do it, but because I want to intentionally force myself to learn new things 
along the way. It's definitely been a little slower and more painful this way, but I think it's been an enlightening and educational experience to say the least.  But also, 
who doesn't want to play with all the new shiny things?

## New Features for the Reboot:
- [ ] Leaderboard that is *less* hackable
- [ ] Scrolling background art
- [ ] Mute sound toggle
