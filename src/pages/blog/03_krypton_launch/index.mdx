***Finally,*** I reached that point in any project where you ask yourself, *"Is this thing ready for 
other people to actually see?"* and you answer confidently and enthusiastically, *"... I 
guess?"*. So, with that out of the way, I shared <a class="arrow" href="https://escapekrypton.com" target="_blank">Escape Krypton</a> with 
a handful of friends yesterday which resulted in the site seeing ***49*** unique visitors 
and nearly ***2,800*** games played! I guess those handful of friends also shared with their friends 
which was a welcome surprise.

## New Features

As you can see, I also added counters to the site to display some stats.
Along with that update, I also wanted to add a little more interactiveness to 
the leaderboard and integrated Twilio SMS notifications.

Players provide their phone numbers during score submission and will be 
notified if their rank drops, and can also select a "taunt" to send along 
with that message to all the players they pass on the leaderboard.

This was very amusing when there were only 3-4 of us playing, but it quickly became a
little spammy and caused friction during the score submission process.  Instead of that, 
I&apos;d like to prioritize the ease at which players can enter their names onto the leaderboard 
without forcing them to enter their phone number.  For the time being I&apos;ve made phone 
numbers optional which I probably should have done to begin with.  Also, 
without SMS verification this can be quickly overrun with fake numbers. These 
changes will go into the Trello backlog for future upates.

Now that the game is in a state that I&apos;m relatively happy with for now, I&apos;ll primarily be working on refactoring 
the codebase and just cleaning it up in general.  I not only migrated the game into TypeScript, Next.js, 
and some React etc., but I was also adding features to the game during that process which led me to neglect 
some areas that could&apos;ve used some extra love.  

## Tech Debt

Young me made a hilariously naive decision when I first made this game, which was 
to implement the "Game Over" scores modal in a *combination* of HTML/CSS ***and*** HTML 
Canvas. I think I probably started off rendering the modal box and 
buttons in Canvas because I was just in that mode throughout the game design, but 
then realized I needed click handlers on the buttons which you can&apos;t exactly attach to 
elements drawn in canvas. That realization with the looming demo day deadline led me to quickly 
float some text in HTML over the canvas and attach click handlers to them.  Honestly, it&apos;s 
not *terrible*, but could&apos;ve been simplified by being just HTML/CSS without the additional 
dependency on the canvas.

On the positive side, I did take the opportunity to implement certain abstractions 
that I had not done the first time around, by creating a `GameObject` interface 
definition implemented by all subclasses of it, such as all the Kryptonite, background 
objects (Stars, Shooting Stars, Planets, etc), and of course Superman himself.The orignal 
game I made implemented it with ducktyping which was a fine approach, but having an explicit contract,
especially with the addition of several new game objects, made everything much clearer to work with.

## Conclusion

Overall, I&apos;m happy so many found the game amusing enough to log that many games played on it 
in a single day.  It&apos;s given me motivation to keep working on and polishing it up.  At the end
of the day I know this can never be really "launched" to the public due to copyrights and what not, but 
it&apos;s just a fun game that I&apos;ve enjoyed working on and am glad that others are able to share in that 
even just for a short while.
